# face-forensics-project
FaceForensics is a video dataset consisting of more than 500,000 frames containing faces from 1004 videos that can be used to study image or video forgeries. To create these videos we use an automatated version of the state of the art Face2Face approach. All videos are downloaded from Youtube and are cut down to short continuous video.
